Tall and dark but close enough to be called handsome.


Currently a Bulacan State University student, studying Computer Science as a 2nd year student.
I want to be a software engineer, beacuse of game development but i prefer spending my time learning web development due to its popularity. 
learning programming and other related stuffs inclinde in software development will help me to be more productive, and being productive will result to being creative, this will make me motivated and passionate.

I love playing basketball as my recreational activity but beacause of pandemic, I switch to cycling; still basketball is more fun and challenging.
For indoor activities I do a lot of online games like MMORPG games FPS games but not MOBA games because i'm kinda bad at playing it.
Lastly I just study, rigth now my favorite lesson is about Database management system, were we store and receive data; this particular lesson will help me to be more knolwedgable about backend development.
